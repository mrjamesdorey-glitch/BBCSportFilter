      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        BBC Sport Filter is a Chrome extension designed to help you personalize your browsing experience on the BBC Sport website by filtering out unwanted sports categories. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how this extension handles your data.

      <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
      <p>
        BBC Sport Filter does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The extension operates entirely on your device and uses the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> The extension uses Chrome’s <code>chrome.storage.local</code> API to store your filter preferences (e.g., categories like "Football" or "Golf") locally on your device. This data is not sent to any external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Website Interaction:</strong> The extension modifies the display of the BBC Sport website (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport</a>) by hiding content matching your filters. No data from the website is collected or stored.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Permissions</h2>
      <p>
        The extension requires the following permissions to function:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save your filter preferences locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Host Permissions:</strong> To access and modify content on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport</a> to apply your filters.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        BBC Sport Filter does not use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking tools. All functionality is self-contained within the extension.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        Since all data (filter preferences) is stored locally on your device via Chrome’s storage API, it is as secure as your device. We do not have access to this data, and it is not shared with any external parties.
