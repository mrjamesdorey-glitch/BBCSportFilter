      <h4>Non-Affiliation with BBC</h4>
      <p>
        BBC Sport Filter is not a BBC product and is not affiliated with or endorsed by the BBC or the BBC Sport website. All modifications to the BBC Sport website (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport</a>) are cosmetic, applied locally on your device, and are fully reversible by uninstalling the extension or removing your filters. The extension allows you to customize which content appears by hiding articles based on your selected categories, teams, or competitions, while preserving the content you want to see.

      <h4>Data Collection and Usage</h4>
      <p>
        BBC Sport Filter does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. The extension operates entirely on your device and uses the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> The extension uses Chrome’s <code>chrome.storage.local</code> API to store your filter preferences (e.g., categories like "Football" or "Golf", or specific teams and competitions) locally on your device. This data is not sent to any external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Website Interaction:</strong> The extension modifies the display of the BBC Sport website (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport</a>) by hiding content matching your filters. No data from the website is collected or stored.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h4>Permissions</h4>
      <p>
        The extension requires the following permissions to function:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> To save your filter preferences locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Host Permissions:</strong> To access and modify content on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport</a> to apply your filters.</li>

      <h4>Data Security</h4>
      <p>
        Since all data (filter preferences) is stored locally on your device via Chrome’s storage API, it is as secure as your device. We do not have access to this data, and it is not shared with any external parties.
